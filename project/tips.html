        That's why we have compiled a list of the best tips and tricks for any pet owner, amatuer to pro.

  <h3>Get regular checkups</h3>

<p>Just like you, your pet can get sick or have health problems. The best way to prevent such sickness or catch them early is to see your veterinarian every year.
Regular exams are the best way to keep your pets happy and heathly. Annual vet visits should touch on nutrition and weight control, as well as cover recommended vaccinations,
 parasite control, dental exam, and health screenings.</p>

  <h3>Spay and Neuter Your Pets</h3>
<p>Eight million to 10 million pets end up in U.S. shelters every year. Some are lost, some have been abandoned, and some are homeless.
The best way to not add to that number is to spay and neuter your cats and dogs. The procedure can be performed as early as six to eight weeks of age.
Spaying and neutering dt just cut down on the number of unwanted pets. It also lowers the risk of you pet getting cancer.</p>

  <h3>Provide an Enriched Environment</h3>
<p>Giving a loving and substantial environment is another key to the long-term health and welfare of your cuddly friends.
Pets need mental stimulation which may mean daily walks, scratching posts, window perches, toys and activites.
It means play time with you, which not only helps keep your pet healthy and strong, it also strengthens your bond with your companion and helps them get rid of their boredom.</p>
